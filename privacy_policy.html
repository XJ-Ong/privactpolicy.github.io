    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 7th February 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 7th February 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how our Messenger bot (‚Äúthe Bot‚Äù) operates. The Bot is designed purely for entertainment purposes and does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users.</p>

    <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The Bot does not collect, store, or process any personal information from users. It only responds to user messages in real-time using an AI model installed locally on our system.</p>

    <h2>3. How the Bot Works</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>User has to ping the bot for it to respond.</li>
        <li>The Bot interacts with users in Messenger and provides responses based on the input received.</li>
        <li>No conversations, messages, or user details are stored or transmitted externally.</li>
        <li>All AI-generated responses are processed on a locally hosted model, ensuring no third-party involvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>While our Bot runs on Facebook Messenger, it does not utilize any third-party tracking, analytics, or external data processing services. However, users should be aware that Facebook Messenger operates under its own privacy policy, which can be found here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank">Facebook Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. User Control</h2>
    <p>Users can stop interacting with the Bot at any time by simply not sending messages. Since no user data is collected or stored, there is no need for data deletion requests.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date at the top of this page.</p>
